 * For this app we will start a thread. Add a MessageQueue via Looper, define

            dispatches them to the Handler. There can be only one message queue and looper for each
            thread in the application.
            3. Handler - Is associated with a thread and its looper. It sends messages to the message queue
            and also handles messages which are dispatched from the message queue. There can be multiple
            handlers for a given Looper and message queue.

            Handler's default constructor takes no argument and it associates the handler with the

            by default. So before instantiating the default Handler instance, it is necessary to
            create a message queue and looper for the current thread. This is accomplished using
            Looper.prepare(). So call this before you create the Handler instance. Also, after
            Handler instance is created, call Looper.loop() to begin looping through the message queue.

            Get handler for Main Thread's Looper using Looper.getMainLooper().

            One more point to note here is that if the handler does not have reference to the main
            thread's looper then it CANNOT update the UI.

                However, if the background task is long running, then it can pose a risk of memory leak.
                What happens if the user rotates the device when the background task is in progress?

                Ideally the system will delete the current activity instance and create a new instance.
                However, this will not be possible since the background thread is still running and it
                holds reference of the parent class. So it will leak the activity class. This has to
                be avoided as far as possible.

                Either make the handler impl static, but then it cannot access member variables of the
                parent class. Or use a weak reference....

                Update 04 Feb 2021 - Default Handler constructor new Handler() is deprecated.
                Implicitly choosing a Looper during Handler construction can lead to bugs where operations
                are silently lost (if the Handler is not expecting new tasks and quits), crashes

                where the thread a handler is associated with is not what the author anticipated.
                Instead, use an Executor or specify the Looper explicitly, using Looper#getMainLooper, {link android.view.View#getHandler}, or similar.
                If the implicit thread local behavior is required for compatibility,
